Trailing Slash on Void Elements
The error about the trailing slash on void elements refers to self-closing tags, like <meta />. While adding a trailing slash is technically allowed in XHTML and some HTML conventions, in HTML5 it doesn't impact functionality. However, it can cause issues when combined with unquoted attribute values or other HTML errors. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to fully address this issue.

<footer> Element Inside Another <footer>
The error about placing a <footer> inside another <footer> arises from improper HTML structure. The <footer> element is not intended to be nested within itself. This was an oversight, and I didn't have time to restructure the elements correctly before submission.

Unmatched Closing <p> Tag
The "No <p> element in scope but a <p> end tag seen" error indicates that there is a closing <p> tag without a corresponding opening <p> tag within the correct scope. This is a common issue when HTML is not properly nested or when a tag is mistakenly closed early. This error was caused by time constraints in the final stages of development.

Conclusion
While these errors have been noted, they donâ€™t significantly impact the functionality of the project. Due to time limitations, I wasn't able to address these issues fully before submission but plan to fix them in future updates.
