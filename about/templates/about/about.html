                <h2>Welcome to My Somali Food Blog!</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Maryan! As someone deeply connected to my Somali heritage, I started this blog to share my love for the rich, aromatic, and diverse flavors of Somali cuisine. 
                    Growing up, food was more than just nourishment—it was a way to celebrate traditions, bring family together, and tell stories of resilience and history.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Why Somali Food?</h3>
                <p>
                    Somali cuisine is a beautiful fusion of influences from the Middle East, India, and East Africa. Whether it’s the fragrant rice dishes, slow-cooked meats, or 
                    the comforting sweetness of shaah (Somali spiced tea), every meal carries a deep cultural significance. The balance of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cumin 
                    creates flavors that are both bold and comforting.
                </p>

                <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
                <p>
                    This blog is my space to explore and document traditional Somali recipes, family favorites, and modern takes on classic dishes. From the beloved 
                    <strong>Bariis Iskukaris</strong> (Somali rice) to the soft, spongy <strong>Canjeero</strong>, my goal is to preserve and celebrate our culinary heritage.
                </p>

                <h3>Join Me on This Journey!</h3>

                    Whether you’re Somali and looking for familiar flavors or new to Somali cuisine and eager to try something different, I hope this blog inspires you to cook, share, and enjoy.  
                    Let’s keep the traditions alive—one meal at a time!
